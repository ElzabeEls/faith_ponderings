        label="6. Judgement&#xa;After death and resurrection we face judgement. We will all stand in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.&#xa;Every word that god spoke will judge us on the last day. For we must all appear one day before the judgement seat of&#xa;Christ, that each one may receive what is due to him for the things doen while in the body, whether good or bad. For&#xa;we know him who said. &#x201c;It is mine to avenge, I will repay, and again, &#x201c;The Lord will judge his people.&quot; It is a dreadful&#xa;thing to fall into the hands of the living God. God &quot;will give to each person according to what he has done&quot; To those&#xa;who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, He will give eternal life. But for those who are&#xa;self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. Whoever believes in the Son has&#xa;eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him. We are justified freely by&#xa;His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Him (Jesus) as a sacrifice of atonement&#xa;through faith in His blood. He did this to demonstrate His justice, because in His forbearance He had left the sins&#xa;committed beforehand unpunished. God is not only just, but also the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.&#xa;On judgement day, Jesus will &quot;separate the sheep form the goats&quot; or the righteous form the wicked &quot;Then they will go&#xa;away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.&quot; whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever&#xa;rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.&#xa;&#xa;The Judgement of sinners&#xa;You cannot enter the kingdom of heaven by calling God 'Lord, Lord alone, Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord Lord,&#xa;did we not prophecy in Your Name, and in Your Name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell &#xa;them plainly, &#x2018;I never knew you. Away form Me, you evil doers.' The Son if Man will send out His angels and they will &#xa;weed  out of His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. Then He will say to those on His left, &#xa;'Depart form me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. I was a stranger and &#xa;you didn't clothe me. I was sick and you did not look after me. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and&#xa;shut out form the majesty of his power. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where &#xa;there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil,&#xa;there will be wrath and anger. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for &#xa;the prophets  and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, &quot;if we had lived in the days of our forefathers, &#xa;we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.&quot; so you testify against yourselves that&#xa;you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up then the measure of sin of your forefathers. &#xa;You snakes! You brood of vipers!&#xa;&#xa;The Judgement of the saints&#xa;Only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter the kingdom of heaven. His mercy extends to&#xa;those who fear Him, form generation to generation. He accepts men form every nation who fear Him and do what&#xa;is right. All who repent form their sins and put faith in Christ will be in heaven forever. Because God is just and our&#xa;justifier, we will not be judged with those who die apart form Christ. Bout our life work will be judged, not to determine&#xa;our eternal destination but to determine our eternal rewards. You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you&#xa;judge your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgement seat. For we must all appear before the judgement&#xa;seat of Christ, that each one may receive  what is due to him for the things done while in the body, whether good or&#xa;bad. his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire&#xa;will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he&#xa;will suffer loss, he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. Not many of you should&#xa;presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. "

Jesus is in very&#xa;nature God, but he did not consider equality with God as something to be grasped. Rather, He made Himself nothing and took on the nature of a servant and was made in the likeness of humans. In the appearance of a human, He humbled Himself and became obedient even to death on a cross. So He died on the cross so became sin and bore our sins and became a curse for us so that we could become the righteousness of God and be redeemed form the&#xa;curse of the law, He laid on Himself the iniquity of us all. By His wounds we have been healed His blood frees us from our sins. Because of this God exalted Him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. God thus made Jesus both Lord and Christ/&#xa;Savior. Jesus came to save the world by giving the gift of eternal life to those who believe in Him, because of His mercy. The blood of Jesus justifies, redeems us, brings forgiveness of our sins, purifies form all sin and brings us near Christ Jesus (God) again... We should thus receive Jesus Christ (savior) as Lord. Jesus Christ is the head of the church and the foundation of the church. Jesus is the way, and the truth and the life. No one comes to the&#xa;Father except through Him. There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. God is with us always, to the very end of the age. The spiritual rock is Jesus Christ. There is one Spirit, one Lord, one God and Father of all. His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness God disciplines His legitimate children so that we may share in His holiness.&#xa;Jesus came to do the following:&quot; The Spirit of the Lord is one me, because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor, He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work. We did not choose God, but God chose us. The amount of authority in the Name of Jesus: Then Jesus came&#xa;to them and said,&quot; All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&quot; That at the Name of Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord the glory of God the Father. &quot;All scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness'&quot; of Jesus: And they sang a new song &quot;You are worthy, to take the scroll and open it's seals, because&#xa;you were slain, and with Your blood You purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation. Since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity, so that by His death He might destroy him who holds the power of death -that is the devil- and free those who all their lives were hold in slavery by their fear of death. The scriptures were originally given by prophecy of scripture by which men spoke form God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. &#xa;Some of the ways The Word benefits the believer is that&#xa;- it is life to a man's whole body &#xa;- makes you wiser than your enemies&#xa;- gives you insight&#xa;- gives you understanding&#xa;- is a lamp to your path&#xa;- gives you great peace and makes that nothing can make you stumble&#xa;-The truth will set you free&#xa;The Scriptures are useful for&#xa;- Teaching&#xa;- Rebuking&#xa;- Correcting&#xa;- Training in righteousness so that the man of God may thoroughly equipped for every good work&#xa;The Law:&#xa;The Law leads to Christ&#xa;- Genesis&#xa;- Exodus&#xa;- Leviticus&#xa;- Numbers&#xa;- Deuteronomy&#xa;Jesus fulfilled 1 of the 3 Laws = Ceremonial Law&#xa;The Laws that are still relevant to us are the Moral Law and some of the Civil Law (divorce, how to deal with dept., etc.), but it all comes down to love God and love others as you love yourself.&#xa;1, Moral Law -No expiration date -Love God &amp; Love others as you love yourself. Remember in your decisions it's legalism if it's duty, it's devotion if it's based on love. It simply comes down to,&quot; is it an act of rebellion or is it who you are? And how will it impact your ability to love and witness to people and your relationship with Christ i.e. is it duty or devotion.&#xa;2. Civil Law (Everything that regulated Jewish civil culture and religion) -Mostly expired with the demise of Jewish civil government, because there is no temple now, Jews of now don't sacrifice, because all that stuff need a temple, so civil law is partially done away with because some things are impractical.&#xa;3. Ceremonial Law -expired by fulfillment of the priestly works of Christ&#xa;&#xa;God The Holy Spirit:&#xa;Holy Spirit Baptism The Holy Spirit is inside of us. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth and another counsellor.&#xa;-The Holy Sprit leads you&#xa;-and guides you into all truth and&#xa;-will tell you what is yet to come&#xa;-He will help us in our weakness, search our hearts and intercede for us in accordance with God's will&#xa;-He will give you power to be God's witness&#xa;-and help the believer by giving him/her what to say when he/she gets arrested.&#xa;-He will teach you all things and remind you of everything God has said to you&#xa;-He will help you guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.&#xa;-He will testify with our spirit that we are God's children.&#xa;You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be His witnesses to the end of the earth.&#xa;The Spiritual giftings are: Prophesying, Serving, Teaching, Encouraging, Contributing to the needs of others, Leadership, Showing mercy.&#xa;The Manifestation of the Spirit that are given for the common good are: Giftings of healing, the message of wisdom, faith, the message of knowledge, distinguishing between spirits, speaking in different kinds of tongues, miraculous powers&#xa;The motivating force behind spiritual gifts is love. The Father gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him. People received the Holy Spirit by a violent wind spontaneously and suddenly coming from heaven with what seemed like tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on them; by the laying on of hands, spontaneously whilst listening to the message of God.&#xa;The result of receiving the Holy Spirit are to begin to speak in other tongues as the spirit enables your soul could see again, praising God, prophesying.&#xa;The gift of prophecy: Everyone who prophecies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. He who prophecies edifies the church. All believers can prophecy so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.&#xa;The gift of tongues: Anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one understands him, he utters mysteries in his spirit. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself. If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. I will sing and pray with my spirit as well as my mind.&#xa;The fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Love is the greatest of the fruit.&#xa;&#xa;Heaven/The New Promised Land:&#xa;**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;And if we stay on this journey all the way to the end we will be with God forever and know Him and His love completely. We will also have brought other people with.&#xa;**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;The pretty and eternal stuff is here. There is no suffering here. Hopefully we end here with more Christians than what there were when we started making disciples. We will be a kingdom of priests. Our citizenship is in heaven. To be &quot;away form the body&quot; (natural) is to be at home with the Lord. Many who do not know God and suppose man is basically good, ask:&quot; How can a loving God send people to hell?&quot; But, once we see&#xa;how utterly sinful man is and how perfectly holy God is, we will ask:&quot; how can a holy God allow sinful men into heaven?&quot; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of God's throne and love and faithfulness goes before Him. God presented Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in His blood. He did this to demonstrate His justice, because in His forbearance He had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished. God is not only just, but also the one&#xa;who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. Jesus rescues us from the coming wrath. What the heavenly beings do with their crowns: Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: &quot;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you&#xa;created all things; and by Your will they created and have their being.&quot; God being glorified  means -God is amazing and beautiful in many ways and when it is being made known to man, God is glorified. Whenever something of God's character is being revealed, God is glorified.&#xa;Michael the archangel makes war (Jude 1:9)(Revelation 12:7) Gabriel gives messages&#xa;"

        label="Unbelievers often believe in Annihilation &amp; Reincarnation:&#xa;Annihilation teaches that human existence is completely terminated by physical death, thus denying the existence of the soul and the justice of God. Reincarnation teaches that upon death the souls of men and animals pass into new bodies of the same of different&#xa;species as punishment or reward, denying the biblical doctrine of eternal judgement. If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, Christians' preaching is useless and so is their faith. More than&#xa;that, Christians are then found to be false witnesses about God, for they testify about God that He raised Christ form the dead. But he did not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised then Christ has not been raised either. And if&#xa;Christ has not been raised, Christians' faith is futile and are still in their sins. Then those who also have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, Christians are to be pitied more than all men.&#xa;&#xa;The condition of the world in relation to the gospel: Do you not say: Four months more and then the harvest; I tell you, open your eyes&#xa;and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life , so that the sower and the reaper may be glad&#xa;together. Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness when he saw the crowds he&#xa;had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then He said to his disciples, &quot;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.&quot; Ask&#xa;the Lord of the harvest therefore, to send out workers in His harvest field.&quot; God is working in everyone's heart and He knows whose hearts (the harvest) is ready when, so He leads us to who&#xa;is ready with His Holy Spirit.&#xa;&#xa;****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;FIRST: Understanding God's mercy and how much He loves us and that we are objects of His mercy.&#xa;****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;We are on a journey with God to be missional to the lost people and show them what God is like. We can be successful in our journey by being in the world, but not of the world&#xa;and by loving God as our first Love and having a true and real and deep relationship with Him from where love can flow to other people.&#xa;Telling people of how God came to save us (sharing the gospel/good news) and thus being a fisher of men is called evangelism:&#xa;If you follow Jesus, He will make you a fisher of men. Jesus gave His disciples authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. They went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons&#xa;and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. We should disciple others. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And teaching them to obey&#xa;everything Jesus has commanded us. God has given this ministry to each believer: All this is form God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as&#xa;though God were making His appeal through us. How can the unbelievers call on the Name of the Lord if they have not believed in Him and how can they believe in the One whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without&#xa;someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As is written, &#x201c;How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.&quot;&#xa;Understanding God's mercy and love and that we are all objects of His mercy, leads to true good works (not striving/legalism) which is to do works of love / to love others, which is a spiritual act of worship of offering our bodies as living&#xa;sacrifices, becoming acceptable offerings to God being glorified because His character is being revealed through us, which makes us God's ambassadors. When you are giving someone the gospel you have a friend on your side inside&#xa;of them, their conscience. In everything you do when ministering to someone, appeal to their conscience and get their conscience on your side and get them to articulate it. They way you hook them is to figure out where their morality&#xa;comes from. Try to get them to link it all up in explaining their belief to you. It is God who saves and delivers etc.. We don't do any of that, but God does it when we do His work and we've got all we need to do His work with inside of us,&#xa;the Holy Spirit. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. Paul's attitude towards sharing the gospel with unbelievers: I am bound both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. That is why I am so eager&#xa;to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome. I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: First for the Jew, then for the Gentile.&#xa;Apologetics is a form of evangelism: Apologetics is a formal discussion/debate event.&#xa;As the good news is spread, the number of disciples will increase rapidly. Cornelius called together his relatives and close friends. While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.&#xa;The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.&#xa;Then Peter said, &quot;Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have&quot;. So he ordered that they be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.&#xa;Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days. Paul preached to both the Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus. When Paul preached a woman&#xa;named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshipper of God: the Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. No-one can come&#xa;to Christ unless the Father who sent Him draws him and He (Jesus) will raise him up at the last day.&#xa;Under persecution, the disciples prayed. Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak Your Word with boldness. After Saul's conversion (Paul) spent several days with the disciples in Damascus before he started&#xa;preaching the gospel. Paul preached fearlessly in the Name of Jesus. Paul requested payer that he might preach the gospel in this manner: Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth words may be given to me so that I will&#xa;fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly as I should. When we share the gospel with lost people, we are engaging in spiritual warfare. Jesus came to&#xa;set the captives free. He frees people as we speak the truth. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the&#xa;heavenly realms. The disciples went out and stepped out in faith and boldly preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed His Word by the signs that accompanied it. When the crowds heard Phillip and saw the&#xa;miraculous signs he did, they paid close attention to what he said. With shrieks evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. So there was great joy in that city. When Paul and Barnabas were continuing to&#xa;preach the good news, the lame man from Lystra was healed. Our part is to boldly preach and pray. As we do this, God will work powerful miracles. We do the preaching, He does the healing. If we lay our hands on sick people they will&#xa;get well. The healing of the crippled man at the Beautiful Gate: Then Peter said, &quot;Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk&quot;. Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and&#xa;instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witness in Jerusalem, and all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&quot; The first promise Jesus&#xa;gave His followers &quot;Come, follow me,&quot; Jesus said, &quot;and I will make you fishers of men.&quot; The last command Jesus gave His disciples: Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptize them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and&#xa;of the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.&#xa;****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;In all of this we start looking like and reflecting God which draws people to us and then we can love them like God loves us and then they will also want to know God.&#xa;FORTH: Which leads to God being gloried because His character is being revealed through us.&#xa;FIFTH: Which means that we are reflecting God to the world which is exactly what we are supposed to do, because we are God's ambassadors on the earth and God's plan to get people saved.&#xa;****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;&#xa; We are now the Israelites (Jews &amp; Gentiles).&#xa;There is one faith. We can now also gain righteousness by believing in Jesus Christ.&#xa;The true gospel is centered around the cross and is one with power that enables us to say yes to life and no to sin. Salvation is a revelation of Jesus. Salvation is a free gift. To keep walking in the life of the gift is a choice and what compels us is revelation.&#xa;The message God has entrusted to us: That God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation.&#xa;Before we see and enter the Kingdom of God We must be born again by the Spirit. We must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. To be saved you must confess with your mouth that &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; and believe&#xa;in your heart that God raised Him form the dead. You must repent and be baptized and then you will receive the Holy Spirit. This promise applies for all whom our Lord will cal. You must devote yourself to the apostles'&#xa;teaching and to the breaking of bread and to prayer. You must meet with the saints together and eat together in each other&#x2019;s homes with sincere hearts. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified.&#xa;Outside of Jesus we are all objects of God's wrath and not entitled to anything.&#xa;&#xa;Foundational teachings of Christianity:&#xa;1. Repentance of acts that lead to death&#xa;2. Faith in God&#xa;We must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. It is confessing the condition of your heart. To be saved you must confess with your mouth that &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead.&#xa;(There would be point in having faith if Jesus was not raised form the dead.)&#xa;3. Instructions on Baptisms&#xa;You must repent and be baptized and then you will receive the Holy Spirit. This promise applies for all whom our Lord God will call. You must devote yourself to the apostles' teaching and the breaking of bread and to prayer.&#xa;You must meet with the saints together and eat together in each other's homes with sincere hearts. There is one faith. Before we see and enter the kingdom of God we must be born again by the spirit. &#xa;3.1 Water&#xa;You shall be baptized in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#xa;We must die to sin before we can be baptized. The New Testament presents four illustrations to help understand water baptism.&#xa;-Burial and resurrection (Romans 6:4,8) we become a new creation.&#xa;-Crossing the Red Sea (1 Corinthians 10:12) The Israelites were freed from their bondage by passing&#xa;through the Red Sea (we were slaves to sin)&#xa;-Circumcision (Colossians 11,12) Baptism is like a spiritual circumcision done by Christ which is a putting off of the sinful nature&#xa;-Noah's flood (1 Peter 3:20,21) The flood of Noah symbolized baptism and baptism is a pledge of good conscience towards God.&#xa;3.2 Holy Spirit&#xa;The new seal of consecration to God is the Holy Spirit.&#xa;The Holy Spirit is inside of us. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth and another counsellor.&#xa;-The Holy Sprit leads you&#xa;-and guides you into all truth and&#xa;-will tell you what is yet to come&#xa;-He will help us in our weakness, search our hearts and intercede for us in accordance with God's will&#xa;-He will give you power to be God's witness&#xa;-and help the believer by giving him/her what to say when he/she gets arrested.&#xa;-He will teach you all things and remind you of everything God has said to you&#xa;-He will help you guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.&#xa;-He will testify with our spirit that we are God's children.&#xa;3.3 Fire&#xa;Jesus will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. Fire = Power. You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be His witnesses to the end of the earth.&#xa;4. Laying on of hands&#xa;When appointing someone into an office&#xa;5. The resurrection of the dead&#xa;6. Eternal judgement&#xa;"

        label="God will be a Father to the believers and we will be His sons and daughters. God promised Abraham that a son form his own body&#xa;will be his heir and that his offspring will be as many as the stars. If you become a child of God you cannot be an object of God's&#xa;wrath anymore. However, you still do not have a right to anything. Those who obey the commands of the LORD our God will&#xa;receive a blessing. If Joshua obeyed God promised the he will be prosperous and successful. Blessed are those who hunger and&#xa;thirst for righteousness for they will be filled. The man who meditates on God's Word is like a tree planted by streams of water,&#xa;which yields fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.&#xa;The man who hears and puts into practice the Word is like a man building a house, who dug a down&#xa;deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came the torrent struck that house, but could not shake it, because  it was&#xa;well built. The hard working farmer (disciple) should be the first to receive a share of the crops. Everyone who is fully trained will&#xa;be like his Master. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain,&#xa;'Move form here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you. If we want our &quot;mountain&quot; to be &quot;thrown into the sea&quot;&#xa;Jesus says, &quot;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain 'Go throw yourself into the sea,' and does no doubt in his heart,&#xa;but believes that what he says will happed, it will be done for him. If we bear fruit that will last, then the Father will give us&#xa;whatever we ask for in His Name. For the cheerful giver: And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at&#xa;all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer;&#xa;believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. What Jesus said about the power of faith: &#x201c;If you can?&quot; said Jesus.&#xa;Everything is possible for him who believes. How can we see these greater works: And I will do whatever you ask in My Name,&#xa;so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in My Name (Jesus), and I will do it. Bring the&#xa;whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house. &quot;Test Me in this, says the Lord Almighty, and see if I will not&#xa;throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it. I will prevent&#xa;pests form devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not cast their fruit.&quot; says the Lord Almighty. &quot;Then all the&#xa;nations will call you blessed, for yours will be delightful land,&quot; says the Lord Almighty. Give, and it will be given to you. A good&#xa;measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be&#xa;measured to you. Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap&#xa;generously. He who pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor. Humility and fear of the Lord bring wealth&#xa;and honor and life. A generous man will himself be blessed for he shares his food with the poor. Prosperity is the reward of the&#xa;righteous. If you are obedient, God will make you prosperous: The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry; diligent hands bring&#xa;wealth. The blessing of the Lord brings wealth, and He adds no trouble to it. Righteousness delivers form death; the righteous will&#xa;thrive like a green leaf. For everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our&#xa;faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. We are children of God and&#xa;whatever will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see His as&#xa;He is. God rewards those who diligently seek Him with His presence and fullness of joy.&#xa;"

        label="******************************************************************************&#xa;But even in repentance we are only letting go of stuff that's bad&#xa;for us anyway. So it's win-win.&#xa;******************************************************************************&#xa;You have to repent. It's the only way of getting back to God. Jesus overcame temptation and defeated the devil by quoting&#xa;the relevant scripture, thus stating the truth and exposing the twisting of the truth by the devil.&#xa;Be alert and of sober mind. Resist the devil, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.&#xa;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&#xa;A Christian can walk in victory over sin by living according to God's Word and by hiding God's Word in his/her heart. We are to repent continually whilst walking&#xa;with God so that we can become more like Him in every situation. It's not out of striving that we choose and want to change.&#xa;Repentance purely is a response to God's great love. We repent because we want to honor Him and also be like Him. It has nothing to do with us or an agenda of self-improvement.&#xa;God never forgets our sin, but He removes it form you and never brings it up/ brings it back to you again; so it's like it never happened.&#xa;&#xa;How to repent:&#xa;Lord I confess that ................, I repent of it now and I choose to not do it ever again. -And you pray this with faith and absolute&#xa;commitment to not doing the sin again, trusting that God will help you not to with the power of His Holy Spirit. After this you use&#xa;the power of the Holy Spirit (the inner strength that He provides) to say no to that sin and not do it when you get tempted.&#xa;&#xa;How to get free form bondage:&#xa;All freedom starts with repentance. We pray and tell the devil to go away in Jesus Name, and people can pray with us to help us fight.&#xa;We fight a bit by ourselves afterwards as well to stay free. To do this, you most importantly have to know who you are and who God is and you have to&#xa;know the Word of God. Abide in Him and then you will know the truth. Be in a close relationship with God and let Him examine your heart.&#xa;Live in the light -let people in close enough and tell your leaders if you got delivered form something by yourself in your room. &#xa;Don't make excuses for sin and bad habits. Be ruthless with sin. If Jesus is your Lord and Savior, you are covered by the blood&#xa;of Jesus. Say aloud: &#x201c;I am redeemed by the blood of Jesus&quot; over and over and, &quot;Jesus is my Savior and in Him I will find my freedom.&quot;&#xa;For forgiveness: What you did was horrible, but even though you did it, I will forgive you.&#xa;"

        label="Sinning is imitating Satan and is devil worship. Anything that is essential to our happiness is an idol.&#xa;Salvation is a process, form the moment of receiving Jesus as Lord and Savior to gaining a full revelation of Him. The question of can you lose your salvation is redundant.&#xa;The Bible is more like: You are saved now, so this is how you work out (live out) your salvation. We are engaged to Jesus; the marriage is going to happen; we have surety of it. You are now a part of the family.&#xa;However, 1 Corinthians 3:10-15 &quot;But each one should build with care. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. I anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,&#xa;their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work. If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. It is burned up,&#xa;the builder will suffer loss but yet be saved -even though only as one escaping through the flames.&quot;&#xa;The only way to lose your salvation is to actively reject it -to 'break the engagement' and turn away form God'. In Jewish culture breaking engagement was divorce (Think about Joseph and Mary).&#xa;If you merely listen to the Word you deceive yourself. Those that live in sin that still think they are Christians are deceived. Anyone that breaks one of the least of the commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.&#xa;If we claim to have fellowship with Him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we claim to have fellowship with God yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not&#xa;live by the truth. The man who says. &quot;I know Him,&quot; but does not do what He commands is a liar, and the truth is not in Him. Anyone who claims to love God but hates his fellow believer is walking in darkness. If anyone says he loves God and yet hates his brother,&#xa;he is a liar. Unreal Christians will bear bad fruit. They will be self serving, have selfish ambition, prideful hearts, sexually immorality, impurity, greediness, obscenity, foolish talk, coarse joking, immorality, debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy,&#xa;fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, orgies and the like in their lives. Worldly sorrow brings death. A perverse man stirs up dissension and dissension is an abomination to God. The Hypocrites love to pray standing in the&#xa;synagogues and on street corners to seen by men. Pagans think their prayers will be heard because of their many words. Hindrances to prayer are cherishing sin in your heart, the Lord will not be listen; doubting, because he who doubts is like a man of the sea,&#xa;blown and tossed by the wind. If you are a husband, not being considerate as you live with your wife, and not treating her with respect as the weaker partner and heirs with you of the gracious gift of life. The hypocrites look somber when they fast. They&#xa;disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. They have received their reward in full. Arguing/debating informally is not a way to try and get people saved.&#xa;Those who do not love Jesus will not obey His commands. Romans 1:21-24 &quot;For although they know God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.&#xa;Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.&#xa;Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with One another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator&quot;&#xa;Those who disobey the commands of the Lord their God and turn from the way God commanded them by following other gods, which you have not known, will receive a curse. Anyone who listens to the word, but does not do what it&#xa;says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a&#xa;house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete. It anyone competes as an athlete he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes&#xa;according to the rules. Any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciples. And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. Men are taken captive through hollow and deceptive&#xa;philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for our sins is left; but&#xa;only fearful expectation of judgement and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God &quot;But because your stubbornness and your unrepentant hearts, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath,&#xa;when His righteous judgement will be revealed. Sin causes you to feel alienated from God, alienation gives birth to condemnation, condemnation gives birth to depravity. When you are at depravity, nothing that you do yourself can&#xa;get you back to God. Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Friendship with the world is hatred towards God and a friend of the world is an enemy of God. Anyone that loves the world does not have the&#xa;love of the Father in him. He who does not love his brother and does what is sinful is of the devil. The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing because it destroys self effort. Anyone who does not have&#xa;the qualities of goodness, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness and love is short-sighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.&#xa;Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit:&#xa;Jesus was ministering in great power by the Holy Spirit. the Pharisees, the religious leaders of the day, were jealous of Jesus and could not believe that this carpenter form galilee (of all places!) was the promised Messiah. They accused him of having an evil spirit&#xa;when it was plain to see that God was with Him. It was in this context that Jesus says to them, 'Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin&quot; -for they are saying , &quot;He has an unclean spirit&quot; (Mark 3:29-30). So&#xa;blaspheming the Spirit speaks of a willful rejection of Jesus and the Spirit's activity on Him. In other words, it is a rejection of Jesus, the anointed one. People who reject Jesus &quot;never have forgiveness&quot; because they reject the very means for forgiveness.&#xa;Therefore blasphemy against the Spirit is not unforgivable in the sense that God is powerless or unwilling to forgive, but in the sense that the sinner is unwilling to receive forgiveness. As a note of warning: Many well-meaning Christians criticize or resist the&#xa;unusual manifestations of the Holy Spirit and call it demonic. I don't believe it is an unforgivable sin, because they are not willfully rejecting Jesus as Lord, but in practice they are rejecting the work of Jesus and quenching the Holy Spirit.&#xa;http://www.four12global.com/articles/theology/what-is-the-unforgivable-sin/&#xa;&#xa;Breakaways and sects are as old as Christianity:&#xa;- works (like circumcision etc.)&#xa;- That Jews are special (Jonah was an Israelite. Like a typical Israelite of that time, he believed that Israel was special and he wanted all of God's promises and everything just for the Israelites and himself; he didn't want to share because he believed Israel is special.&#xa;This is the pride that Israel had. The stumbling block to faith is pride. Jonah didn't want to preach to Nineveh, because he didn't want them to also be saved. Then after the fish and preaching and everyone in Nineveh being saved, he was sitting under a cucumber tree&#xa;being upset with God still for actually saving them as well.) To the Jews, Jesus was the stumbling block/stone because He came by grace and faith, but they missed it because they were so fixated on trying to make it themselves.&#xa;In Romans Paul says that that no one can be upset about Israel missing it (recognizing Jesus and the gospel) because God has done so much for them and even raised up other nations to show them who He is and to make them jealous, so that they could come back to Him, but they didn't.&#xa;If Israel would respond there would be a rich harvest form that and it will be amazing for everyone (all nations) if they do. This still means the Israelites that live by faith.&#xa;&#xa;- Universalism (There are more ways to God/heaven than just Jesus)&#xa;- The Gnostics (There is special knowledge that is needed to be acquired in order to know God.)&#xa;- The opposite of works (Licentiousness/Hyper grace)&#xa;- Self-improvement gospel (A critical spirit will defile you. Don't have a critical spirit. With the self-improvement gospel you need constant encouragement from others, constant affirmation)&#xa;- The therapeutic gospel ( It's all about you; about following your heart and Jesus just wants you to be happy)&#xa;- Teaching only the repentance of John&#xa;&#xa;-Head faith (Head faith is merely agreeing to a set of religious creeds and historical facts about Jesus. Even the demons believe that there is one God, and shudder, but they are not saved.)&#xa;- Feeling Faith (Thomas is famous for having &quot;feeling faith&quot;. His faith was based on his five physical senses. If his physical senses were not convinced, then he would not believe. So the other disciples told him, &quot;We have seen the Lord!&quot; But he said to them,&#xa;&quot;Unless I see the nail marks in His hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into His side, I will not believe it&quot;.)&#xa;- Dead faith (In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action is dead. Such faith cannot save a person. According to James, the body without the spirit is faith without works and is thus dead.)&#xa;- Crisis faith (&quot;Crisis faith&quot; is also known as temporal faith. It is awakened by adverse circumstances. As soon as the bad circumstances change, crisis faith disappears without a trace. The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who&#xa;hears the Word and at once receives it with joy. But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time; when trouble or persecution comes because of the Word, he quickly falls away. The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears&#xa;the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. Still others, like seed sown among thorns hear the Word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires of other things come and choke the&#xa;Words, making it unfruitful. Some worries of life that choke the Word are worries about you life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. It is impossible to serve both God and Money. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a&#xa;trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. Wealth is worthless&#xa;in the day of wrath; whoever trusts in his riches will fall. Then He said to them, &quot;watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possession!&quot;. There is no point in storing up stuff for ourselves here on&#xa;earth. You cannot take it with you to heaven. The Lord thwarts the craving of the wicked. Lazy hands make a man poor. Misfortune pursues the sinner; a sinner's wealth is stored up for the righteous. The whole nation of God's people were under a curse&#xa;because they were robbing Him in the tithes and offerings. The wicked man flees though no-one pursues. Fear of man will prove to be a snare.&#xa;"

        label="God came to seek man; He still spoke to people sometimes.&#xa;**You can see that what made these men significant was that they lived by faith. They were on a journey with God to be missional to the lost people and show them what God is like.**&#xa;**By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God speaks well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.**&#xa;God chose Job so that God could be glorified through Job. He made some people to be used as potties and some to be used as beautiful vases.&#xa;God chose Adam's son Seth and then Enosh and then Kenan and then Mahalalel and then Jared and then Enoch and then Methuselah and then Lamech and then Noah&#xa;(Noah and the flood)&#xa;God allocated a number of 120 years maximum to humans after the flood.&#xa;(The Tower of Babel)&#xa;(Great Pyramids of Egypt constructed 2630 BC) (Iron objects manufactured in the ancient Near East 2500 BC) (Egyptians use papyrus and ink for writing 2500 BC) (Egyptians import gold form other parts of Africa 2400 BC)&#xa;(Sumerian king, Sargon, becomes first &quot;world conqueror&quot; 2331 BC) (Horses domesticated in Egypt 2300 BC) &#xa;(Abraham)&#xa;(Abraham is born 2166 BC) (Ziggurats built in Mesopotamia 2100 BC)&#xa;and then God chose Noah's son Shem and then Arphaxad and then Cainan and then Shelah and then Eber and then Peleg and then Reu and then Serug and then Nahor and then Terah and then Abram who became Abraham.&#xa;Some scholars say Abraham and his family were the most doomed family on the face of the earth at that point in time. They were nomads that didn't have their own land.&#xa;(Abraham travels to Canaan 2091 BC) By faith Abraham, who was a pagan worshiper Joshua 24:2, when called by God to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.&#xa;God told Abraham that he will be the father of many nations and God's Word did not fail, because many different nations apart form the Jews, have since been added to the faith. Those who are not His people will be called His people (other nations). ** Abraham believed what was spoken over him by God and it was accredited to Him as righteousness.**&#xa;From Abraham onwards God set a pattern where He didn't choose the first born (The one who traditionally would be the greatest or the most worthy etc.). God's plan has always been to choose the child of the promise, the one He picked, and that one often was the least. Man's plan was the first born and the most and the best; God's plan is not.&#xa;God sees believers as sons of Abraham, more than He sees us as sons of our natural fathers, if we have the same faith the same faith as what Abraham had. It's about being a child of the promise, and the promise is Jesus.&#xa;This again refers to The Law. Man's way is to try and do it by The Law and via stuff and works, but God's way is by faith. The point Paul is trying to make in Romans is that even Abraham got it by faith guys, it's not about trying to make it on your own with your own works and out of your own strength. Ismael (Islam is form Ismael); the whole current&#xa;Islamic nation is because of Ismael. God was still faithful to His promise. He made all of Abraham's seed come to a nation, both Ismael and Isaac. Islam are the people of The Law still. The are still the people of pride and Law, trying to do it themselves with their own strength and through works; still fighting against Christians.&#xa;**By faith, Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son.**&#xa; **Abraham was fully persuaded of that God had power to do what He had promised. Without weakening his faith, Abraham faced the fact that his body was as good as dead -since he was a hundred years old**&#xa;**and that Sarah's womb was also dead. He thus still had faith even though he fully considered the facts.&#xa;Yet Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God. By faith Abraham, even though he was past age -and Sarah herself was barren- was enabled to become a father because he considered Him faithful who had made the promise**&#xa;Circumcision was the mark  -the seal- of consecration to God&#xa;(Isaac is born 2066 BC)&#xa;The slave that went to go get Rebekah as a bride for Isaac, took gifts with. So the Holy Spirit comes to get the bride (the believers) for the groom (Jesus) and He also brought gifts along = The gifts of the Holy Spirit.&#xa;(Jacob &amp; Esau are born 2006 BC) &#xa;Esau/Edom (Esau and his offspring) stood as an example of pride and Israel (Jacob renamed) stood by faith. Edom was an example of man trying to do it by themselves. They tried to build up themselves and do it in their own way, but God destroyed them and wiped the whole nation off of the face of the earth.&#xa;Then God chose Abraham's son Isaac and then Jacob who became Israel (whose offspring were the Israelites form Israel's twelve sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulum, Dan, Joseph, Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad and Asher) &#xa;(Stonehenge erected in England estimated 2000 BC) (Jacob flees to Haran 1929 BC) (Joseph is born 1915 BC)&#xa;and then God chose Israel&#x2019;s son Joseph (Joseph's sons: Manasseh and Ephraim). (Spoked wheels invented estimated 1900 BC)&#xa;(Joseph sold into slavery 1898 BC) Our circumstances don't always reflect our spiritual faithfulness -Just like with Joseph.&#xa;(Joseph rules Egypt 1885 BC) (Jacob moves to Egypt 1876 BC) (Jacob&#x2019;s/Israel's son Joseph brought the Israelites to Egypt where they were later oppressed) (Joseph dies 1805 BC)&#xa;(Slavery in Egypt around 1800-1446 BC)&#xa;Then God chose Joseph's brother Levi (born to Israel form Leah) (Levi's sons: Gershon, Kohath and Merari) and then Kohath and then Amram (whose children were Moses, Aaron and Miriam) and then Moses (Moses' sons: Gershom and Eliezer)&#xa;(Moses is born 1526 BC)&#xa;**By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter: He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. By anger he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.** (Mexican Sun Pyramid built 1500 BC)&#xa;(The Exodus 1446 BC)&#xa;**By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the first born would not touch the first born of Israel.**&#xa;**By faith the Israelites passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.**&#xa;Many people forget that God is also a judge. When killing the Egyptians, it was His judgement. He gave them many opportunities to let His people go, but the Word says they hardened their hearts. If they had just let the Israelites go they would not have&#xa;died, so it was His judgement against them. He had a covenant with the Israelites and called them out to worship Him. As His people God covers them, and was fighting for them. If God is for you, who can stand against you.&#xa;The rest of Romans in context with Romans 1: Where God said that God gave the sinful and unrepentant people over to their sinful hearts and allowed them to be hardened. Just like with Pharaoh, God allowed unrepentant Pharaoh to be given over to His sin and become hardened (Romans 9:17) and He allowed Pharaoh to be even more hardened&#xa;and hardened so that He could display His glory. It was all about His glory. God used pharaoh as a potty -So what. God is a mystery, we cannot understand how He decides or thinks.&#xa;(Ten Commandments given 1445 BC)&#xa;God gave The Law. The law includes sacrifice of animals of the forgiveness of sins. The Law points to Christ.&#xa;God first gave the ten commandments then started giving Moses the Law and then instructed them to build the tabernacle all on the same day on Mount Sinai. Moses came down with the tablets and saw the golden calf and then broke the stone&#xa;tablets with the ten commandments, that God had given them, and then burned the golden calf in the fire and crushed the gold into powder and threw the powder into a stream that flowed down the mountain. Then Moses met with God various times&#xa;at the tent of meeting outside the camp a distance away. Only after a few meetings with God and after Moses asked God to show him His glory and after God put Moses in the cleft of a rock and covered him with His hand while His glory passed by, did&#xa;God command Moses to chisel out two new stone tables and make a wooden chest to put them in and only then did he go back up the mountain for God to write the ten commandments on the stone tablets again.&#xa;Then the tabernacle was built and the glory of God filled the tabernacle. The Levites were appointed by God to be charge of the tabernacle of the covenant law. Aaron (Moses' brother) had four&#xa;sons (Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar), but Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before God in the Sinai Desert and they had no sons so only Eleazar and Ithamar served as&#xa;priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron. The tribe of Levi (The Gershonites, Kohathites and Merarites) were brought and presented to Aaron the priest to assist him at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.&#xa;God spoke to Moses form the Tent of Meeting and gave him the rest of the law. (The second Passover 1445 BC)&#xa;(Israel refuses to enter Canaan 1443 BC) (First metal-working in South America 1440 BC)&#xa;The first generation that came out of Egypt that died in the desert, died because of their grumbling, unbelief and disobedience. Their death before going into the promised land was the consequence of their own action, there again God's judgement for their sin.&#xa;God continued to give Moses the law.&#xa;God was glorified by the engulfment of the rebellious Israelites, because it reveals something of His character; it reveals His intolerance of rebellion.&#xa;(Moses dies 1406 BC) It is possible for a man/woman of great faith to die without receiving the promise.&#xa;By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people marched around them for seven days.&#xa;After using the lineage of Joseph's brother Levi, God returned to the lineage of Joseph. Joseph's son was Ephriam whose son was Beriah, his son Rephah, his son Resheph, his son Telah, his son Tahan his son Ladan, his son Ammihud,&#xa;his son Elishama, his son Nun and his son Hoshea. God chose the son of Nun whose name was Hoshea, but Moses gave him the name Joshua.&#xa;(Joshua leads Israel into Canaan/The Promised Land 1406 BC)&#xa;(Water clock invented in Egypt 1400 BC) (Palace of Knossos on island of Crete destroyed by earthquake 1380 BC) &#xa;(Judges begin to rule in Israel 1376 BC)&#xa;(King Tutankhamen is buried in Egypt amidst great treasure 1358 BC) (Silk fabrics manufactured in China 1250 BC)&#xa;(Israel Stele; a monument honoring Pharoah Merneptah is the earliest evidence for the existence of the nation of Israel outside the Bible 1213 BC)&#xa;(Deborah becomes Israel's Judge 1209 BC)&#xa;(First Chinese dictionary 1200 BC) (Destruction of Troy, in Turkey, during the Trojan war, using the Trojan horse 1183 BC)&#xa;(Gideon becomes Israel's Judge 1162 BC)&#xa;(Samuel is born 1105 BC)&#xa;(Samuel becomes Israel's final Judge 1075 BC)&#xa;(Saul becomes king 1050 BC)&#xa;After using the lineage of Joseph, God started using the lineage of Joseph's brother Judah. Judah's son was Perez, his son Hezron, his son Ram, his son Amminadab, his son Nahshon, his son Salmon, his son Boaz, Obed, his son Jesse, his son David.&#xa;(David anointed as king 1025 BC) (David defeats Goliath 1020 BC) (David becomes king in Judah 1010 BC) (David becomes king over all Israel 1003 BC) (David's sons: Amnon, Kileab/Daniel, Absalom, Adonijah, Shephatiah, Ithream, infant who died&#xa;without being named, Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, Eliphelet and another unnamed son who also would have died in infancy.)&#xa;(Mayans settle in the Yucatan peninsula 1000 BC) (Native Americans in California build wood-reed houses 1000 BC)&#xa;(Solomon becomes king 970 BC)&#xa;(Solomon begins building the Temple 970 BC) (The Temple is completed 960 BC)&#xa;(Gold vessels and jewelry popular in Northern Europe 950 BC) (Israel divides into two nations 930 BC)&#xa;(Asa begins to rule in Judah 910 BC)&#xa;(Celts invade Britain 900 BC)&#xa;(Omri begins to rule in Israel 885 BC)&#xa;(Elijah begins his ministry 875 BC)&#xa;(Evidence of highly developed metal and stone sculptures in Africa 850 BC)&#xa;(Ahab dies in battle 853 BC)&#xa;(Elisha's ministry begins 848 BC)&#xa;(Joash begins to rule in Judah 835 BC)&#xa;(Founding of Carthage 814 BC) (Homer's Iliad Odyssey written down 800 BC)&#xa;(Jonah begins his ministry 793 BC)&#xa;Jonah was an Israelite. Like a typical Israelite of that time, he believed that Israel was special and he wanted all of God's promises and everything just for the Israelites and himself; he didn't want to share because he believed Israel is special. This is the pride that Israel had.&#xa;The stumbling block to faith is pride. Jonah didn't want to preach to Nineveh, because he didn't want them to also be saved. Then after the fish and preaching and everyone in Nineveh being saved, he was sitting under a cucumber tree being upset with God still for actually saving them as well.&#xa;(First known Olympics occurs 776 BC)&#xa;(Amos begins his ministry 760 BC)&#xa;(Legendary date for founding of Rome 753 BC) (Earliest musical notation in Greece 750 BC)&#xa;(Isiah begins his ministry 740 BC)&#xa;If God did not, in His mercy, choose a remnant from Israel (the descendants) through which He knew His plan would come to pass, Israel would also have been wiped off of the face of the earth just like Sodom and Gomorrah. God called Israel to be His&#xa;nation to show Himself to the nations around them who He is. He was glorified and lifted up by Israel so that there was a witness for all to see Him as the One true God. When Israel disobeyed God used other nations to rise up against Israel as His&#xa;instrument of discipline to bring them to repentance and back to Him.&#xa;(Assyria destroys Samaria 722 BC) (First known lock and key in the palace in Assyria 710 BC) (Sennacherib taunts Hezekiah 701 BC) (Japan founded as a nation 660 BC) (Soldering iron invented 650 BC) (Horse racing first held at 33rd Olympics 648 BC)&#xa;(Jeremiah begins his ministry 627 BC)&#xa;(Law scroll found in the Temple 622 BC) (Nineveh destroyed 612 BC) (Neco kills Josiah in battle 609 BC) (First captivity; Daniel taken to Babylon 605 BC) (The Temple of Artemis is constructed in Ephesus 600 BC)&#xa;(Second captivity; Ezekiel taken to Babylon 597 BC) (Greek astronomer Thales predicts an eclipse 585 BC) (Babylon destroys Jerusalem 586 BC) (Pythagoras, Greek philosopher and mathematician is born 582 BC)&#xa;(Ezekiel's vision of a restored Temple 573 BC) (Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism is born in India 563 BC) (King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon dies 562 BC) (Aesop writes his fables 560 BC) (Daniel's first vision 553 BC)&#xa;(Confucius is born in China 551 BC) (Cyrus the Great conquers the Medes, founding the Persian Empire 550 BC) (Horseback postal service in the Persian Empire 540 BC) (Babylon overthrown by Cyrus of Persia 539 BC) (Daniel thrown to the lions 539 BC)&#xa;(Daniel prays for his people 538 BC) (Cyrus allows exiles to return to Jerusalem 538 BC) (Zerubbabel leads 50 000 people back to Jerusalem 538 BC)&#xa;(Polo played as a sport in Persia 525 BC) (Public libraries open in Athens, Greece 520 BC) (Haggai and Zechariah serve as prophets 520 BC)&#xa;(Second Temple completed in Jerusalem 515 BC)&#xa;(Rome becomes a republic 509 BC) (Greeks repel Persia in the Battle of Marathon 490 BC)&#xa;(Esther becomes queen of Persia 479 BC)&#xa;(Festival of Purim originates 473 BC) (Socrates, famous philosopher is born 469 BC) (Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, is born 460 BC) (Ezra leads another group of returning exiles to Jerusalem 458 BC)&#xa;(The Golden Age begins in Athens, Greece 457 BC) (The Parthenon is built in Athens, Greece 448 BC) (Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem 445 BC) (Plato, famous philosopher, is born 429 BC) (Socrates condemned to death 399 BC) (Aristotle is born 384 BC)&#xa;(Plato writes The Republic 370 BC) (Alexander the Great defeats the Persian Empire 330 BC) (Romans build first paved road, the &quot;Appian Way&quot; 312 BC) (Hebrew Old Testament begins to be translated into Greek -Septuagint around 255 BC)&#xa;(Romans conquer Sicily 241 BC) (Great Wall of China built 215 BC) (Antiochus IV plunders Jerusalem Temple 169 BC) (Judas Maccabeus begins a revolt against Antiochus IV 165 BC) (Jews and astrologers banished form Rome 139 BC) &#xa;(First Chinese ships reach east coast of India 102 BC) (Julius Caesar, first emperor of Rome is born 100 BC) (Romans conquer England 55 BC) (Cleopatra becomes last independent Egyptian ruler 51 BC) &#xa;(Julius Caesar becomes dictator for life, assassinated 2 years later 46 BC) (Romans make Herod the Great king of Judea 37 BC) (Cleopatra and Marc Anthony commit suicide 30 BC) (Sumo wrestling in Japan 23 BC)&#xa;(Herod the Great begins remodeling Temple in Jerusalem 20 BC) (Mary, Jesus' mother, is born 20?

The Law and the Oral Law got passed down as a unit acting together. As the living conditions, time and culture of the Israelites changed form being in the desert all&#xa;the way though possessing the promised land and exile etc., the Levite priests kept writing new versions of the &quot;Oral Law&quot; with different applicable ways of practical implementation for every situation. First only a designated rabbi decided how to practically implement The Law in each community, but then three strands were eventually formed.&#xa;(Eventually (in AD 1563) the Shulcan Arukh version of the Oral Law, with it's practical implementations, became the most popular version of the Oral Law in attempting to compose an all inclusive version of the Oral Law again that can work as a unit with the original Written Law.)&#xa;http://www.four12global.com/articles/theology/the-jewish-roots-movement-and-its-mistakes/            |             http://www.four12global.com/articles/theology/jewish-roots-part-two-jesus-or-yeshua/&#xa;Jesus didn't come to show us how to live; He came to show us the Father, in the hope that we will be captivated by Him and choose to embark on a journey with Him of getting to know Him and how much He loves us and that He is love. God reached down the ranks and became a servant and now all of mankind has a chance to be redeemed.&#xa;God, in His wisdom, chose to have mercy on those He chose to have mercy (the descendants); the ones through which He knew His plan would come to pass in the way He wanted.&#xa;Israel has experienced a hardening in part until all the gentiles that want to choose to be saved have given their lives to God.&#xa;&#xa;Order of the books: Genesis (undated-1805 BC), Job (around 1900 BC), Exodus (1500-1445 BC), Leviticus (1445-1444 BC), Numbers (1445-1406 BC), Deuteronomy (1406 BC), Joshua (1406-1376 BC), Judges (1376-1100 BC),&#xa;1 Samuel (1105-1010 BC), Ruth (around 1100 BC), 2 Samuel &amp; 1 Chronicles (1010-970 BC), Song of Songs &amp; Ecclesiastes (around 950 BC), 2 Chronicles (970-538 BC), 1 Kings (970-853 BC), 2 Kings (853- 561 BC), Jonah (793-753 BC),&#xa;Amos (760-750 BC), Hosea (753-715 BC), Micah (742-687 BC), Isaiah (740-681 BC), Nahum (663-654 BC), Zephaniah (640-621 BC), Jeremiah (627-585 BC), Habakkuk (612-589 BC), Daniel (605-536 BC), Ezekiel (597-571 BC), Lamentations (586 BC),&#xa;Obadiah (around 586 BC), Ezra (538-450 BC), Haggai (520 BC), Zechariah (520-518 BC), Esther (483-473 BC), Nehemiah (446-432 BC), Malachi (430s BC)&#xa;"

You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the&#xa;days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and&#xa;hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&#x201d; To the woman he said, &#x201c;I will make your&#xa;pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children.

After he drove the man out, he placed on&#xa;the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to&#xa;the tree of life. Death was introduced to the world through Adam and Eve's sin. We were never supposed to&#xa;die, but because of the fall we do. Death grieves us because it reminds us that we are under a curse.&#xa;We were never supposed to be subject to death. We were all supposed to have lived forever.&#xa;We were never supposed to suffer loss of anyone for any period of time.&#xa;Now everything on earth is beautiful, because it was made by God,&#xa;but it is cursed and temporary.

We are on a journey and in a process of preparation to be married to God (Jesus). God builds His church and He is the author and finisher of our faith. He leads, not us, we just fall in with His lead and then He uses us as instruments. We are all on a journey together as one. We cannot do it alone. Ephesians 4:16 &quot;From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in loves, as each part does its work.&quot;&#xa;We are now the new Israelites (Jews &amp; Gentiles). We are on a journey with God to be missional to the lost people and show them what God is like. We can be successful in our journey by being in the world, but not of the world and by loving God as our first Love and having a true and real and deep relationship with Him from where love can flow to other people.&#xa;We are a family. All the believers -across the world- are a family and committed to each other as family (filos &amp; agape). Unity and Oneness is very important to God because He is a triune God and the church family should reflect this unity.&#xa;The Leadership structure God has placed in the church are: Elders, Deacons&#xa;The Gifts Jesus Christ gave to the church are: Apostels, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers&#xa;4.The laying on of hands: when appointing someone into an office is applicable here.&#xa;The eye cannot say to the hand &quot;I don't need you!&quot; And the head cannot say to the feet, &#x201c;I don't need you!&quot; On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and parts we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in&#xa;the body, but parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Jesus prayed: &#x201c;My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that You have sent Me. The gates of Hades will not overcome God's church. The ultimate destiny of the church is to be made&#xa;holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through The Word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. &#xa;&#xa;Elders (an Office):&#xa;Titus was left in Crete to appoint elders. Elders are appointed, not elected. An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. Since an overseer is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless -not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.&#xa;He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer he desires a noble task. Now the overseer must be above reproach, self controlled, respectable, hospitable, able te teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle; not quarrelsome; not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him&#xa;with proper respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?) He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgement as the devil. He must also have a good reputation with outsiders so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap. To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow-elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who will share in the glory to be revealed: Be shepherds of God's flock that&#xa;is under your care, serving as overseers -not because you must, but because you are willing: as God wants you to be; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away. Men only (subject to God's calling) because there are only male examples in the Bible. In the church context only, women cannot lead men. Elders are the highest authority in the church. &#xa;Elders can carry a gift form Jesus Christ (functioning as an Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor of Teacher), because if you are equipping you are leading others thus only leaders can carry these gifts. Elder=Overseer. Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood. So the twelve gathered all the disciples together and said,&quot; It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the Word of God in&#xa;order to wait on tables. We will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the Word. They are supposed to feed God's lambs and take care of all of His sheep. The word of the Lord came to me: Son of man, speak to your countrymen and say to them, &#x2018;When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people, then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take&#xa;warning, his blood will be on his own head. If he had taken warning, he would have saved himself. But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them, that man will be taken away because of his sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood. Son of man, I have made you a watchman of the house of Israel; so hear the Word I speak and give them warning form me when I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you&#xa;will surely die, and you do not speak out to dissuade him form his ways, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. But if you warn the wicked man to turn form his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but you will be saved yourself. Son of man, prophesy and say to them: &#x201c;This is what the Sovereign Lord says Woe to the shepherd of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with wool&#xa;and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd and when they were scattered, they became food for the wild animals. The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.&#xa;For the Scripture says, &#x201c;Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,&quot; and &quot;The worker deserves his wages.&quot; &#xa;&#xa;Deacons (an Office):&#xa;Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. In the same way, their wives are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his household&#xa;children and his household well. Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. Acts 6 is the first appointment of deacons. A deacon can be a man or a woman. Romans 16 Phoebe, a woman deacon. &quot;servant&quot; can translate &quot;deacon&quot;. Everyone that has the hope of seeing Jesus will purify himself, just as He is pure. Can also be a woman, because there are examples in the Bible. The deacons are there to assist the elders by serving the practical needs&#xa;of the saints. Deacons can carry a gift form Jesus Christ (functioning as an Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor of Teacher), because if you are equipping you are leading others thus only leaders can carry these gifts. Deacons can thus be men or women (subject to God's calling).&#xa;&#xa;Apostles (Gift form Jesus Christ -an Office):&#xa;Exercising discipline, bringing correction, being custodians of sound doctrine, bringing balance, strengthening churches, protecting and fostering relationships. Ephesians 2:19,20 - to set foundation on which God's household is built. Ephesians 3:5 To reveal insight into the mystery of Christ. They make sure the works of a church is cared for, rooted properly in Christ and placed within an apostolic field. To parent orphaned churches. To equip the saints in the unity of the faith, unity in the knowledge of Jesus,&#xa;until we mature to the fullness of Christ. Providing vision, providing safety, preparing God's people for Good work, providing exposure to Christ in other churches, holding leaders and pastors accountable, giving perspectives on difficult matters, strengthening, providing continued leadership training. Men only because there are only male examples in the Bible. In the church context only, women cannot lead men. Whenever Jesus expands and begins to express His rule on the earth, through the church, He begins&#xa;with apostles. Apostles come first in order of prominence, authority, responsibility and order. They have a field of influence in which they operate and they operate in team. Apostolic teams do not have authority over every local church, but only over those entrusted to them by Christ. Apostolic cross-pollination did happen and that different apostolic teams were also able to speak into the other team; in order to ensure that all were rooted properly in Christ and healthy. Apostolic leaders must submit themselves&#xa;for audit form time to time, both to apostles within their respective fields, and to other apostolic leaders outside of their field. This is done in order to ensure that truth prevails. This provides a greater accountability for leaders, and safety for the churches within each field. Paul (1 Corinthians 1:1) Barnabas (Acts 14:14) Andronichus (Romans 16:7) Junias (Romans 16:7) Epaphroditus (Philippians 2:25) Timothy (of 1 Thessalonians 1:1 &amp; 6:7) Silas/Silvanus (of Thessalonians 1:1 &amp; 6:7) Apollos (1 Corinthians 4:6-9)&#xa;Titus (2 Corinthians 12:18). Types of Apostles are: Message apostles, witnesses, specific apostles, master builders, leading apostles, pioneer apostles maintaining/reworking apostels. (Then anyone that is sent by the church can also function as an apostle, but not in the office of an apostle) Elders are ordained by apostles and apostles entrust some of their authority to local elders.&#xa;Apostolic Delegates: Pricilla &amp; Aquilla (Acts 18) Erastus (Acts 19:22) Onesimus (Colossians 4:9) Phoebe (Romans 16:1) Trophimus (Acts 20:4) Tychicus (Colossians 4:7-8). Apostles are thus men only (subject to God's calling). Their area of influence is great, such as over entire congregations -it reaches further than individual one on one influence. Their purpose is to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of&#xa;the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. The top priorities of the apostles are to give their attention to prayer and the ministry of the word. The gifts of Jesus Christ work&#xa;with the elders in submission to the elders as it is to the elders that the care of the saints has been given.&#xa;&#xa;Evangelists (Gift form Jesus Christ -an Office):&#xa;To share the gospel and do the pre-work unto salvation (the &quot;work of an evangelist&quot;). Often travels form place to place. Can also be a woman, because there are examples in the Bible. Acts 21:8 Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven. Philip (Acts 21:8) Possibly Epaphras (Colossians 1:7) An evangelist is someone who proclaims good news; in other words, a preacher of the gospel or a missionary. A person with the gift of evangelism is&#xa;often someone who travels form place to place to preach the gospel and call for repentance. The human authors of the four Gospels -Matthew, Mark, Luke and John- are sometimes called &quot;the Evangelists&quot; because they recorded the ministry of Jesus Christ &quot;good news&quot;. In Acts 21:8 Philip is named an evangelist and in 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul exhorts Timothy to do the work of an evangelist. Philp had been one of the Seven deacons chosen so that the apostles could do their work of teaching and prayer (Acts 6:3).&#xa;Philip's previous evangelic work was in Samaria (Acts 8:4-8). He &quot;proclaimed the Messiah to the Samaritans and performed miracles, including casting out demons and healing paralytics&quot;. It is noteworthy that Philip performed water baptism in the Name of Jesus, but the baptism of the Holy Spirit did not occur until the apostles came to Samaria. Philip's trailblazing efforts laid the foundation for his hearers to receive the Holy Spirit. The evangelist's pre-work unto salvation is what evangelists do. The Ethiopian&#xa;eunuch is another example of Philip's evangelism. Evangelists can thus be men or women (subject to God's calling). Their area of influence is great, such as over entire congregations -it reaches further than individual one on one influence that all saints can do. Their purpose is to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.&#xa;Their purpose is to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament,&#xa;grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. The gifts of Jesus Christ work together with the elders in submission to the elders as it is to the elders that the care of the saints has been given.&#xa;&#xa;Prophets (Gift form Jesus Christ -an Office):&#xa;Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers. Acts 15:32. 1 Corinthians 14:3 But the one who prophecies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 1 Corinthians 14:22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however is not for unbelievers but for believers. Ephesians 2:19,20 To set foundation on which God's household is built. Ephesians 3:5 to reveal insight into the mystery of Christ.&#xa;1 Timothy 4:14 Do not neglect your gift which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you. Can also be a woman, because there are examples in the Bible. 1 Corinthians 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. And if revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For all can prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the&#xa;control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace -as in all the congregations of the Lord's people. If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way. 1 Corinthians 14:1-2 Follow the way of&#xa;love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. 1 Corinthians 13:9,12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face. Ephesians 2:19-20 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. Lucius (Acts 13: &amp; Romans 16:21) Silas (Acts 18:32 -also an apostle)&#xa;Agabus (Acts 4:7, 21:10) Possibly the four daughters of Philip (Acts 21:9). Prophets can thus be men or women (subject to God's calling). Their area of influence is great, such as over entire congregations -it reaches further than individual one on one influence that all saints can do. Their purpose is to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature,&#xa;attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. The gifts of Jesus Christ work together with the elders in submission to the elders as it is to the elders that the care of the saints has been given.&#xa; &#xa;Pastors (Gift form Jesus Christ -an Office):&#xa;John 21:15-17 Jesus charges Peter to feed and tend His sheep. A pastor teaches the word of God to the flock, 91 Timothy 3:2, Titus 1:9), brings the flock to maturity, and to be resistant to heresy. they are on guard for false teachers and warns those who stray that there are consequences to their belief and behaviour. In 1 Peter 5:1,2 Peter exhorts elders to shepherd the flock of God and serve as overseers, caring for the flock as they wait for the Chief Shepherd.&#xa;Men only because there are only male examples in the Bible.  In the church context only, women cannot lead men. Epaphras, Archippus (Philemon 2; Collosians 4:17) Gaius (Romans 16:23; and a member of Paul's travelling team Acts 20:4) Jason (Acts 17) Justus (Acts 18:7) Onesiphorus (2 Timothy 1:16, 4:19) The word pastor comes form a Latin word which means &quot;shepherd&quot;. The New Testament presents two offices that constitute church leadership, elder/overseer and deacon. Paul lists the qualifications for&#xa;elders/overseers in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9. Notice that in the 1 Timothy passage, Paul refers to them as overseers (episcopos in Greek). From this can be concluded that there is one office with different designations (in Titus he refers to them as elders presbuteros in Greek). The word elder refers to the life experience of the office holder to watch over the congregation and meet their spiritual needs. The second office is that of a deacon, which is described in Acts 6:1-6. Paul outlines the qualifications&#xa;of a deacon in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. The deacons' responsibility is to minister to the physical needs of the congregation, freeing up the elders to concentrate on the spiritual needs. In acts 20:28, Paul said to the Ephesian elders, &quot;Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood&quot;. In the New Testament pastor=overseer each word providing different emphasis on contribution.&#xa;Thus men only (subject to God's calling). Their area of influence is great, such as over entire congregations -it reaches further than individual one on one influence that all saints can do. Their purpose is to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants,&#xa;tossed back and forth by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. The gifts of Jesus Christ work together with the elders in submission to the elders as it is to the elders that the care of the saints has been given.&#xa;&#xa;Teachers (Gift form Jesus Christ -an Office):&#xa;Hebrews 5:15-17 To teach the elementary truths of God's word. Men in office of a teacher can bring &#x2018;new&#x2019; doctrine into the church, but it should be in submission to the pastors as they are in charge van doctrine, disciple en direction. Can also be a woman, because there are examples in the Bible, but woman teachers cannot bring in new doctrine, because, In the church context only, women cannot lead men. 1 Timothy 2:7 And for this&#xa;purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle -I am telling the truth, I am not lying- and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles. 2 Timothy 2:2 You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. James 3:1 Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. &#xa;Luke (wrote NT book Luke &amp; Acts) Mark (wrote NT book Mark, 2 Timothy 4:11) Tertius (A scribe to Paul, Romans 16:22) Tyrannus (leader of a school, Acts 19:9-10). Thus men or women (subject to God's calling). Their area of influence is great, such as over entire congregations -it reaches further than individual one on one influence that all saints can do. Their purpose is to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity &#xa;in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. The gifts of Jesus Christ work together with the elders in submission to the elders as it is to&#xa;the elders that the care of the saints has been given.&#xa;&#xa;Unknown Gifts:&#xa;Aristachus (fellow worker, Philemon 24; travelling team, Acts 19:29; fellow prisoner Colossians 4:10) Apphia (possibly wife of Philemon -fellow worker, Philemon 2) Demas (fellow worker) Justus/Jesus (fellow worker, Colossians 11) Lydia (hospitality, Acts 16:40) Nymphus (hosted a church, Colossians 4:15)&#xa;&#xa;Saints:&#xa;All other believers.&#xa;- - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&#xa;&#xa;Applicable to Everyone (Elders, Deacons, Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, Saints):&#xa;&#xa;God's Greatest Commands:&#xa;The Greatest Command: &#x201c;Mark 12:30-31 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: &#x2018;Love your neighbor as yourself. &#x2018;There is no commandment greater than these.&#x201d;&quot; There is one faith.&#xa;&#xa;Everyday life:&#xa;***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;Life is a constant decision between life and death. By the power of the Holy Spirit we can pick life every time.&#xa;So now He invites us on a journey with Him in which we get to know Him better and understand His love for us better. This journey is so captivating and overwhelming that we decide that we want to honor God with our everything, so we respond to Him and His love by wanting to be just like Him, because we think He is so amazing. This leads us to repentance.&#xa;We are objects of God's mercy and once we understand that and God's mercy and grace, it leads us to true good works which are not out of striving or legalism, but out of overflow of revelation. These true good works (fruit that last) are to love/ to love others/ works of love which is a spiritual act of worship and we should in this way become an acceptable offering to God by offering our bodies as living sacrifices that are holy and pleasing to God.&#xa;This leads to God being glorified because His character is being revealed through us and this makes us God's ambassadors on earth and God's plan to get people saved. Love will lead to unity. Now Jews and Gentiles can be one.&#xa;***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;Saved by faith is a full leaning on God. It's not a God that does much, but we also have to do our little bit.&#xa;The Greatest Command: &#x201c;Mark 12:30-31 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: &#x2018;Love your neighbor as yourself. &#x2018;There is no commandment greater than these.&#x201d;&quot;&#xa;God is our King, anchor and rock. With Him we have eros, agape and filos love. Eros refers to passionate or romantic love; filos to friendship love and agape to selfless love. We are in love and fellowship with Him and we are His faithful servants and stewards.&#xa;Falling in Love with God: As you look back and see how He has changed you, how He loves you, you will love Him and as you fall in love with Him it will cause you to trust Him so much -you will keep loving Him more and more and more. As this happens&#xa;you will find those quiet times in the day to hear Him speak to you. As He does you fall in love with Him even more. So that's the falling in love part.. trusting God more and more and more (to the point of being willing to be completely vulnerable?) Yep. we are all in different stages of this out of the more time we spend with Him, the more honest we are the better it gets. Not relying on ourselves and what we think but becoming fully dependent on Him.&#xa;Like a friendship it takes time. Intimacy with God: Intimacy with a boyfriend that results in sex is really lust. The intimacy that you have with a husband is more than sex Though that is the culmination of the relationship but the intimacy is that you are known by one another. It's when that person knows you inside and out, that they can look at you an know how you are feeling without saying anything.&#xa;Sometimes they can just feel how you are feeling. It's a place where you are so open and vulnerable -they know you inside and out, there is no secrets. It's a place where you share your hopes and dreams -encourage each other etc. Intimacy with God is like that of a marriage. It's where you are known by God you know Him intimately.&#xa;You seek Him out to hear His thoughts. There are no secrets -you share your dreams, fears, failures and good times with Him. You trust Him with absolutely everything. It would be almost the same as standing naked before your husband. So as a believer we fall in love with Jesus, we live in the light, have no secrets form Him. He becomes our everything. As we seek Him, we find that still small voice and He speaks uniquely and intimately to every person.&#xa;It's where we give up our will to seek His will for our life. As we receive His love, we learn to love as He loves us... If we know about someone like Nelson Mandela we learn stuff about him, but if we spend time with the person we become known by them -That's intimacy. The more we get to know Him the more we fall in love with Him as we realize how much He loves us and what He did on the cross for us. Sex with a boyfriend comes with no commitment that person&#xa;takes that precious moment -it becomes more about the physical feeling of enjoyment and when things go wrong it ends and in a sense there is a tearing as you have given yourself to someone who no longer wants to be together. God created sex for pleasure, for procreation an to bring two people together (like glue). He designed this for marriage. This is when sex when married is like the glue that seals two different people and makes them one. It's that real&#xa;intimacy. It's where you are no longer your own person and that person is no longer their own. You are now two people as one person. (So the parallel is that intimacy with God is safe because He is committed to you and you to Him spending time with Him completely vulnerable will be like glue for your relationship with Him?) There is a sharing and trusting that person with all your heart and your everything. Yes it's when you come to the understanding that He&#xa;made you -so He knows how you think, act, feel, behave and you come to Him in absolute awe of what He has saved you from, how much He loves you, how He has plans for you, how He wants you to grow in Him and become who He made you to be. He never leaves you and He keeps building into you. Jesus is The Word; we become living 'words'.&#xa;Salvation is a process, form the moment of receiving Jesus as Lord and Savior to gaining a full revelation of Him. The question of can you lose your salvation is redundant. The Bible is more like: You are saved now, so this is how you work out (live out) your salvation. We are engaged to Jesus; the marriage is going to happen; we have surety of it. You are now a part of the family. We are in preparation to get married to Jesus. The Holy Spirit helps us to become like Jesus in every situation. Our identity in who we are&#xa;comes form the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in you will witness to you (tell you) (giving you certainty) that you are God's child/bride (that you are saved). We now said yes to Jesus. The marriage is going to happen. He is now away preparing the marriage. We are now engaged. We are preparing ourselves as a pure and spotless bride. We are in the engagement period. (That is why keeping yourself pure during your engagement period with your earthly husband is important, because it's a reflection of where we are at the&#xa;moment with God.) The slave that went to go get Rebekah, as a bride for Isaac, took gifts with. So the Holy Spirit comes to get the bride (the believers) for the groom (Jesus) and He also sent gifts along = The gifts of the Holy Spirit. We have surety of being married, but do not have all the benefits (intimacy) of being married yet. We are now in the &quot;beautification&quot; (sanctification) process of getting clean and pretty and getting ready for marriage -being ever ready for the surprise coming back of the groom, just like in Jewish culture.&#xa;God is love. God loves us. If we go on a journey with Him to discover who He is and how much He loves us, we will want to honor Him and be like Him and that will lead us to repent. Even in that the things we will repent of will be sinful things which are death to us. So it will never be like God is asking you to let go of something that's good for you, so even that is His love. In all of this we will begin to reflect Him which will lead to other people also being captivated by Him, which will lead to them doing the same which will lead&#xa;to all of us being saved form hell. It's not about how we serve Him; it's about how we position ourselves before Him. Those that are positioned correctly can be used more/more effectively. Pick to be like Mary, not Martha. Faith is not a feeling, it's a fact. Faith pursues God. It pushes through all the hard parts. Working out of your salvation is not just believing in Jesus, but also believing in what He has spoken over you -it's not literal work like striving or earning; it's just believing and keeping going. We have become new beings on a new&#xa;journey, we just have to let our bodies reflect it. God builds His church and He is the author and finisher of our faith. He leads, not us, we just fall in with His lead and then He uses us as instruments. We are all on a journey together as one. We cannot do it alone. Ephesians 4:16 &quot;From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in loves, as each part does its work.&quot;&#xa;God might have predestined you to be a mug, but because of the fall, you might be living as a vase. Everything that's happening in your life was not predestined. You having an affair or getting into a car crash was not predestined, but just because you might be living as a vase right now, does not change the fact that you were predestined to be a mug. The only way you will ever become the mug you were destined to be, is if you surrender to and live according to the Holy Spirit. The good God works for all who love Him is&#xa;being conformed to the image of His Son. Romans 8:28-30 &quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose (those that are currently walking according to the Spirit). For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.&quot;&#xa;So if your sin or the devil lets something bad happen to you, God will work it for the good by conforming you to His likeness, so that you can be more like Him. Living in abundant live is about God being our portion and having joy and peace in all circumstances, and being fruitful because we are abiding in and empowered by God. He has set us up for victory. Philippians 4:12 &quot;I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in every situation, whether well fed or&#xa;hungry, whether living in plenty ot in want.&quot; We must obey everything He commands. Do not put out the Spirit's fire. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. We should eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. God's command to Joshua was to not let the book of The Law depart from his mouth, to meditate on it day and night so that he may be carful to do everything written in it. Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.&#xa;Faith is a gift form God and a decision that someone makes. Every saved person has thus made that decision and that makes everyone's faith equally significant, no matter their background. We are to also reach down and become servants. Matthew 20:26 &quot;Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,&quot;. For those who live according to the Spirit, the Spirit will lead you to do things of the Spirit and not the flesh. Servanthood is honor. Thus we must not like positions, or desire positions because of the&#xa;'honor it might bring'. Imitation of God is the best kind of worship. We imitate God and love Him and love others (and do true good works) because of our captivation and revelation of who God is; it's something that happens in response and &quot;working out your own salvation&quot; = to just keep going and getting to know God better. It's not to keep your salvation. Wanting to become like Jesus requires continuous repentance and asking the Holy Spirit to make you like Jesus and then choosing to be so. Letting go of sin is just letting go of stuff.&#xa;that's bad for us and stuff that no only hurts us, but also hurts God because He loves us.&#xa;And now, o Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to Him, to love Him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me; but showing&#xa;love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments. And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him (with His presence). Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. We have hope a an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain. But remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the&#xa;ability to produce wealth, and so confirms His covenant, which He swore to your forefathers, as it is today. The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, He is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. So because you understand God's mercy, you respond with true good works, that are not legalism or striving. These works are works of love/to love. Loving others is a&#xa;spiritual act of worship of offering our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.&#xa;Some of the ways The Word benefits the believer is that&#xa;- it is life to a man's whole body &#xa;- makes you wiser than your enemies&#xa;- gives you insight&#xa;- gives you understanding&#xa;- is a lamp to your path&#xa;- gives you great peace and makes that nothing can make you stumble&#xa;-The truth will set you free&#xa;The Scriptures are useful for&#xa;- Teaching&#xa;- Rebuking&#xa;- Correcting&#xa;- Training in righteousness so that the man of God may thoroughly equipped for every good work&#xa;The Law:&#xa;The Law leads to Christ&#xa;- Genesis&#xa;- Exodus&#xa;- Leviticus&#xa;- Numbers&#xa;- Deuteronomy&#xa;(Jesus fulfilled 1 of the 3 Laws = Ceremonial Law&#xa;1. Ceremonial Law -expired by fulfillment of the priestly works of Christ)&#xa;2. Moral Law -No expiration date -Love God &amp; Love others as you love yourself. Remember in your decisions it's legalism if it's duty, it's devotion if it's based on love. It simply comes down to,&quot; is it an act of rebellion or is it who you are? And how will it impact your ability to love and witness to people and your relationship with Christ i.e. is it duty or devotion.&#xa;3. Civil Law (Everything that regulated Jewish civil culture and religion) -Mostly expired with the demise of Jewish civil government, because there is no temple now, Jews of now don't sacrifice, because all of that stuff need a temple, so civil law is partially done away with because some things are impractical.&#xa;The Law now only makes us conscious of sin. The Laws that are still relevant to us are the Moral Law and some of the Civil Law (divorce, how to deal with dept., etc.), but it all comes down to love God and love others as you love yourself.&#xa;Sin no longer has power. God knew the overall quantity of sin for the past, present and future, but as we become increasingly aware of our sin via the law and eventually the conviction of the Holy Spirit, we also become increasingly aware of the extent of our own sin and the extent of God's mercy that covers all of it.&#xa;Look at it in the light of Romans 13:8 Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. Romans 14:13 therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but determine this -not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way. Therefore all things are viewed in light of love with a desire to live out there the great commission to go and make disciples. Eg. if you are in a culture where it would be offensive&#xa;for a man to have no beard, then one should grow a beard in order to share Jesus in that culture. When we have ladies go into Malawi on outreach they wear long skirts or wraps because that is their culture and it would be offensive for a lady to wear shorts. In order to minister we become all things to all people, provided it's not sin. With the thing of periods, look at the times they lived and why God would give that Law. He says blood is unclean, likewise a dead body.&#xa;So think about the time where people did not bath every day like we do today; it's for hygiene reasons and prevention of the spread of disease throughout the camp. God did not say don't eat pork because he felt like it. Pork carries parasites, so he was protecting them. In our days we bath every day, so this becomes no issue. With tattoos -there are some cultures in which they would be offensive. I know people who have been prevented from going on outreach because they have a tattoo.&#xa;In this case they couldn't go into all the world and make disciples. Even within our own country you will find that there are different groups that would be closed to receive form a person with a tattoo. &#xa;So you don't know all that God has in store for you, so I see it as I present all of myself to God and not be a stumbling block to be used by God . Remember we discussed the reason why we don't drink alcohol, same reason applies (stumbling block for others potentially). Romans 14 talks about accepting one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgement...&#xa;v7 For not one of us lives for himself and not one of us dies for himself, for if we live, we live for the Lord and if we die, we die for the Lord... Thus going back to Romans 13:8... for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. Love God and love people as you love yourself. So your question is about what laws to apply, My answer is -it's not about legalism because love one another fulfills the law.&#xa;With regards to the tattoo and dyeing your hair issue: You are living in a culture that mostly accepts it; if you had to go into a situation to minister that didn't accept it you could dye it. Hair colour is not permanent or earrings that could be taken out. A tattoo is not so easy to remove a tattoo. This is why I said you have to look at scripture and come to your own conviction about what you believe. It's a grey area that Christians don't all agree on and the bottom line is one day you will give an account to God of all things.&#xa;You also have to be careful that you don't take on cultural norms that are not biblical. Remember in you decisions it's legalism or it's duty, it's devotion if it's based on love. God looks at the heart not the outward, but sometimes the outward can be a stumbling block to others, so it's not about being accepted by God, but by willingly presenting ourselves to Him to be fully used by Him and not judging others who have a different view.&#xa;God calls us to a holy life. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Paul said disciples should endure hardship like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one serving soldier gets involved with civilian affairs -he wants to please his commanding officer. If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. Paul says before we start building we should count the cost (building our faith, discipleship). Therefore, my&#xa;brothers, you whom I love and long for, my joy and my crown, that is how you should stand firm in the Lord, dear friends (Philippians 4:1). Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death and I will give you the crown of life. True Christians will bear good fruit: He who does what is right is righteous. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because he has been&#xa;born of God. Godly character and true good works, a life in relationship and submitted to the Lordship of Jesus. Those who build their lives on Jesus, to whom His Kingdom becomes first priority in their lives and those that begin to reflect and do what Jesus did. These fruit will include the fruit of the Spirit, but will also be our good works. People that give God all the glory and continually point people to Jesus. We can bring glory to the Father by bearing much fruit showing ourselves to be His disciples. no branch&#xa;can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Thus, in order to bear spiritual fruit we must remain in Him and His words and Him is us. Disciples will devote themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. David's greatest desire was that He may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of his life to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek Him is His temple. The sons of Korah's souls panted for God like a deer pants for streams of water. Their souls&#xa;thirsted for God, for the living God. The Psalmist's attitude towards God's presence was God's dwelling place is lovely and his soul yearns; even faints, for the courts of the LORD, his heart and his flesh cries out for the living God. He says better is one day in God's courts than a thousand elsewhere. He would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. David said that the Law form God's mouth is more precious to him than thousands of pieces of silver and gold; that God's&#xa;words are sweet his taste, sweeter than honey to his mouth. He loves God's commands more than pure gold. He loved God's Law. Job treasured the words of God's mouth more than his daily bread and did not depart from the commands of God's lips. Jeremiah said that when God's words came, he ate them; they were his joy and his heart's delight, for they bear God's Name. The Bereans received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures daily. Paul boasted in the cross of our Lord Jesus&#xa;Christ. Through His very great and precious promises we may participate in His divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness knowledge, and to knowledge self control and to self control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you posses these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you form being&#xa;ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. If you do these things, you will never fail. Trails/testing of the faith develop perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. Consider it pure joy whenever you face trails, because the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and&#xa;character hope. We should be disciple and disciple others. We should be in a community group and a church family. God disciplines His legitimate children so that we may share in His holiness. Christianity is more than just religion. It is relationship between God and man. All relationships grow through communication. The better the communication the better the relationship will be. Communication is a two step process involving talking and listening. God talks to us in many ways, but primarily through His Word. We&#xa;talk to Him through prayer. We listen to Him as we read the Bible. He listens to us when we pray. We respond to His Word with action. He responds to our prayer with action. Faith is is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. Faith comes form hearing the message, and the message is heard through the Word of Christ. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. Know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. You are all sons of&#xa;God through faith in Christ Jesus. Clearly no-one is justified before God by the law, because &quot;The righteous will live by faith&quot;. Everything that does not come from faith is sin. We put our faith in God. We should live by faith, not by sight, even when our senses contradicts our faith. Then Jesus told him, &#x201c;because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&quot;. A true believer should show his faith by what He does. Real faith is not just heard. It is not always&#xa;confirmed by feelings. It must produce action and it must last a lifetime. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. Since we have been justified through faith. Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we may have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart form observing the Law. God&#xa;justifies those who have faith in Jesus Christ. This righteousness form God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference. For in the gospel a righteousness form God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith form first to last. Just as it is written &quot;The righteousness that comes form God is by faith. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -and this is not form yourselves, it is the gift of God. To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to&#xa;become children of God. For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one; &quot;Have faith in God&quot;, Jesus answered. If we want our &quot;mountain to be thrown into the sea&quot;. Jesus says, &#x201c;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go throw yourself into the sea', and does not doubt in his heart but believes what he says&#xa;will happen, it will be done for him. Everyone who has the hope of seeing Jesus will purify himself, just as He is pure. A good man leaves an inheritance for his children. The righteous man is as bold as a lion. Whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe. God chose and appointed us to go bear fruit -fruit that will last. Paul's belief in the resurrection effected his life in the way that he was always striving to keep his conscience clear before God and man. To be alive &quot;in the body&quot; (natural) is to be away form the Lord.&#xa;Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and your staff they comfort me. Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize. We are objects of God's mercy; we don't deserve anything. We are&#xa;destined for death and wrath. It is a great equalizer among men. When you become a child of God you can no longer be an object of God's wrath. However, you still don't have a right to anything. So because you understand God's mercy on you, you respond by doing true good works, that are not legalism or striving. These works are works of love / to love. Renewing your mind is an encounter with God. So if you want to renew your mind, submerge yourself in who He is. Just serve faithfully with whatever gift&#xa;you have got and you will be just like everyone else that serves faithfully with the gift that they have got, because no one is better than anyone else. Loving others (true good works that flow out of a revelation of God's mercy for us) is a spiritual act of worship of offering our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. God being glorified means that God is amazing and beautiful in many ways and when it is being made known to man, God is glorified. Whenever something of God's character is being&#xa;revealed, God is being revealed, God is glorified. God created us, the Potter made us in original design and placed us in His home in close relationship with Him. Then because of original sin we went missing.. So what God does is that He comes to look for us and then He takes us out of wherever we are and puts us back into His home. Then also, if there is anything about us that does not look like our original design because of the sin and circumstances that we were in, He takes that away and shapes us&#xa;back to our original design again. Remember your leaders, who spoke the Word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you. Now we ask you brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the&#xa;highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. Brothers, pray for us. If your brother has something against you, first go and be reconciled to your brother. If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and&#xa;if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. But I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat. What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside &quot;Expel the wicked man form among you.&quot;&#xa;Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. You should come out form them and be separate and touch no unclean thing, because bad company corrupts good character. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. God calls us to a holy life. Christian fellowship has benefit because two together have a good return for their work; if one falls down his friend can help him up. If they lie down together they will keep warm and if they fight together they can&#xa;defend themselves. If we call Jesus Lord we will do what He says. Those who love Jesus will obey His commands and teaching. Real disciples hold to God's teaching. This is love for God: to obey His commands. And His commands are not burdensome. To be men and women of faith we must have unwavering faith in the fact that God is powerful = God is able (Romans 4:21) and the fact that God is faithful = God is willing (Hebrews 11:11). Jesus promises: &#x201c;I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do even&#xa;greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.&quot; If you follow Jesus, He will make you a fisher of men. Jesus gave His disciples authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And teaching them to obey everything Jesus has commanded us. &#xa;Romans 12:3-13:10 &quot; For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.&#xa;We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your[a] faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead,[b] do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.&#xa;Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with the Lord&#x2019;s people who are in need. Practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.&#xa;Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God&#x2019;s wrath, for it is written: &#x201c;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&#x201d; says the Lord. On the contrary:&#xa;&#x201c;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.&#x201d; Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.&#xa;Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.&#xa;For the one in authority is God&#x2019;s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God&#x2019;s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.&#xa;This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God&#x2019;s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. The commandments, &#x201c;You shall not commit adultery,&#x201d; &#x201c;You shall not murder,&#x201d; &#x201c;You shall not steal,&#x201d;&#xa;&#x201c;You shall not covet,&#x201d; and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself. &#x201c;Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.&quot; We are on a journey with God to be missional to the lost people and show them what God is like. We can be successful in our journey by being in the world, but not of the world and by loving God as our first Love and having a true and real and deep relationship with Him from where love can flow to other people.&#xa;Likewise to Israel, we as Christians as the church are His instruments to make known the manifold wisdom and glory of God to the lost and dead around us. So when we go through trail it's our response to God that displays His glory. If we die to self and live for God, we are in a sense saying to God, You are worth it all, nothing matters to me other than You. This is done out of revelation of who God is of knowing His goodness and love. We chose to make it about Him. He is who He is despite what we think or do, but He is inviting us&#xa;to share in who He is. We give Him the glory by not taking it for ourselves and making it all about Him. So when we go through trail it's our response to God that displays His glory, the fruit of our labor displays His glory. The thing of &quot;His burden is light&quot; is saying that if you follow God in doing His work, it will not be a burden.&#xa;Foundational teachings of Christianity that we should teach to those we are making disciples of and that we should do ourselves:&#xa;The true gospel is centered around the cross and is one with power that enables us to say yes to life and no to sin. Salvation is a revelation of Jesus. Salvation is a free gift. To keep walking in the life of the gift is a choice and what compels us is revelation.&#xa;1. Repentance of acts that lead to death&#xa;2. Faith in God&#xa;We must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. It is confessing the condition of your heart. To be saved you must confess with your mouth that &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead. (There would be point in having faith if Jesus was not raised form the dead.)&#xa;Before we see and enter the Kingdom of God We must be born again by the Spirit. We must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. To be saved you must confess with your mouth that &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him form the dead. You must repent and be baptized and then you will receive the Holy Spirit. This promise applies for all whom our Lord will call. You must devote yourself to the apostles'&#xa;teaching and to the breaking of bread and to prayer. You must meet with the saints together and eat together in each other&#x2019;s homes with sincere hearts. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified.&#xa;3. Instructions on baptisms&#xa;3.1 water&#xa;You shall be baptized in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. We must die to sin before we can be baptized. The New Testament presents four illustrations to help understand water baptism.&#xa;-Burial and resurrection (Romans 6:4,8) we become a new creation.&#xa;-Crossing the Red Sea (1 Corinthians 10:12) The Israelites were freed from their bondage by passing through the Red Sea (we were slaves to sin)&#xa;-Circumcision (Colossians 11,12) Baptism is like a spiritual circumcision done by Christ which is a putting off of the sinful nature&#xa;-Noah's flood (1 Peter 3:20,21) The flood of Noah symbolized baptism and baptism is a pledge of good conscience towards God.&#xa;3.2 Holy Spirit (The Holy Spirit descended on Pentecost AD 30) The new seal of consecration to God is the Holy Spirit.&#xa;You must repent and be baptized and then you will receive the Holy Spirit. This promise applies for all whom our Lord God will call. You must devote yourself to the apostles' teaching and the breaking of bread and to prayer. You must meet with the saints together and eat together in each other's homes with sincere hearts. There is one faith. Before we see and enter the kingdom of God we must be born again by the spirit. The Holy Spirit is inside of us. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth and another counsellor.&#xa;-The Holy Sprit leads you&#xa;-and guides you into all truth and&#xa;-will tell you what is yet to come&#xa;-He will help us in our weakness, search our hearts and intercede for us in accordance with God's will&#xa;-He will give you power to be God's witness&#xa;-and help the believer by giving him/her what to say when he/she gets arrested.&#xa;-He will teach you all things and remind you of everything God has said to you&#xa;-He will help you guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.&#xa;-He will testify with our spirit that we are God's children.&#xa;The Spiritual giftings are: Prophesying, Serving, Teaching, Encouraging, Contributing to the needs of others, Leadership, Showing mercy.&#xa;The Manifestation of the Spirit that are given for the common good are: Giftings of healing, the message of wisdom, faith, the message of knowledge, distinguishing between spirits, speaking in different kinds of tongues, miraculous power the motivating force behind spiritual gifts is love. The Father gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him. People received the Holy Spirit by a violent wind spontaneously and suddenly coming from heaven with what seemed like tongues&#xa;of fire that separated and came to rest on them; by the laying on of hands, spontaneously whilst listening to the message of God. The result of receiving the Holy Spirit are to begin to speak in other tongues as the spirit enables your soul could see again, praising God, prophesying.&#xa;The gift of prophecy: Everyone who prophecies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. He who prophecies edifies the church. All believers can prophecy so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.&#xa;The gift of tongues: Anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one understands him, he utters mysteries in his spirit. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself. If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays,&#xa;but my mind is unfruitful. I will sing and pray with my spirit as well as my mind.&#xa;The fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Love is the greatest of the fruit.&#xa;3.3 fire&#xa;Fire Baptism Jesus will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. Fire = Power. You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be His witnesses to the end of the earth.&#xa;4.The laying on of hands: when appointing someone into an office&#xa;5. The resurrection of the dead&#xa;6. Eternal judgement&#xa;The question is not will God prosper me, the question is what will I do with God's abundant provision? He will make you rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. Hospitable = to love strangers; lost people (filos &amp; agape). &#xa;Put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.&#xa;In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord&#x2019;s people.&#xa;&#xa;Accountability:&#xa;Brotherly affection is key. If you love others, live in the light. Speak the truth in love. Build each other up in love. When we have love, we can speak the truth to each other. Brotherly affection is distinguished from charity by nearness and dearness. Closer than a brother. Someone whose desire for God is the same as yours. Being accountable means opening up to perspective in all aspects of life -being open and vulnerable. the point is to foster relationships where you open up. Be teachable. The heart is deceitful above all things.&#xa;Love always believes the best of someone. Victory is won through many advisers. The heart is deceitful above all things. Accountability is a safeguard so that the enemy cannot find a foothold in our lives and it helps you get unstuck as well. You cannot overcome in your own strength. Accountability is so that you do not have to fight alone. Warfare is being in the light. Be accountable to God -He will do everything He can to help you turn form a bad thing. Obey your leaders and submit to them. Also be accountable to your friends&#xa;-the brotherly affection type ones. Also be accountable in community in conversation. Be interdependent.&#xa;*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;SECOND: Leads to true good works which are out of overflow of revelation and not out of striving or legalism, and these good works are works of love /to love others. It also includes being a good steward, because God is a good steward. So in the process of becoming more like Him and getting greater and greater revelation of His love and who He is, you will become like Him and will start loving people and being a good steward of everything that He has entrusted to you, because that is who He is.&#xa;Being a good steward of everything that God has entrusted to you includes being a good steward of your relationships, your health and your possessions. It means being good at your job and , looking after your house and everything that you own. It also means looking after and caring for your body and yourself by exercising and looking after your emotional-, mental- and spiritual health and using your talents. Being a good steward of your emotional-, mental- and spiritual health includes building healthy boundaries.&#xa;God can use therapy as a tool in your sanctification process along with your accountability and guidance of your leaders, to help you in your sanctification process by teaching you how to be a good steward of yourself and your relationships. Proverbs 4:23&#xa;&#x201c;Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.&#x201d;&#xa;However, Renewing your mind is not cognitive behaviour therapy, it's an encounter with God. So if you want to renew your mind, submerge yourself in Him.&#xa;THIRD: Which is a spiritual act of worship of offering our bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to God.&#xa;*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#xa;&#xa;Communion:&#xa;Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgement on himself. That is why many among you are weak and sick; and a number of you have fallen asleep. But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgement. Partaking in communion in&#xa;an unworthy manner refers to the relationship between the church members. So if you take communion when you have a relational issue or something against someone then you shouldn't take communion, you should rather go sort it out. In 1 John it talks about the fact that you can't say you love God but not love your brother so our communion with God is affected by our communion with one another. We get our instruction as to why we do communion form Jesus. The Jews had the Passover to remember&#xa;that God took them out of Egypt and what He had done for them. Jesus, when He was saying, &quot;do this in remembrance of me&quot; He was saying , when you take communion remember what I have done for you. Therefore old testament covenant becomes new testament covenant.&#xa;&#xa;How to Treat your Brother:&#xa;Some want to be vegetarians, some think Christmas is a pagan festival. Do not judge your brother, go according to your own faith and conscience and do not let your brother stumble. Love will lead to unity. Now Jews and Gentiles can be one even though some have eaten pork their whole life and some haven't. This unity glorifies God, because it displays something of His character. God being glorifies means that God is amazing and beautiful in many ways and when it is being made known to man, God is&#xa;glorified. Whenever something of His character is being revealed, God is glorified. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret will reward you. Do not have fellowship of even eat with anyone who calls himself a brother, but is sexually immoral or greedy, or an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. When this happens the church should be filled with grief and put&#xa;the man who does this out for their fellowship. We must teach new believers to obey everything God has commanded us, after baptizing them. If you remember that your brother has got something against you, first go and be reconciled to your brother. If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two elders along so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or&#xa;three witnesses'. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan ot a tax collector. To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow-elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed: Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers -not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not lording it&#xa;over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flocks. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another -and all the more as you see the Day approaching. They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property&#xa;and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.&#xa;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.&#xa;&#xa;Discipline from God:&#xa;When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline) then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. no discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. Those branches that bear fruit He prunes so that they will be even more&#xa;fruitful&#xa;&#xa;Worship:&#xa;A time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks. God is Spirit, and His worshippers must worship in Spirit and in truth. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another -and all the more as you see the Day approaching. Therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably&#xa;with reverence and awe, for our &quot;God is a consuming fire&quot;. Some external expressions of acceptable worship -clap your hands, all you nations, shout to God with cries of joy. God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets sing praises to God, sing praises to our King, sing praises. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to His name; bring offering and come into His courts worship the Lord in the splendor of His holiness tremble before Him, all the earth; sing to the Lord a new&#xa;song, for He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation for him, make music to the Lord with the harp and the sound of singing, with trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn -shout for joy before the Lord, the King: Let them praise His name with dancing and make music to Him with tambourine and harp; Praise Him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise Him with the harp and lyre, praise Him with tambourine and dancing, praise Him with the clash of cymbals. praise&#xa;Him with resounding cymbals; Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. The early church met for worship and prayer; They were taught publically and from house to house and everyday they continued to meet together in the temple courts; They broke bread together in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts. About midnight Paul and Silas were praising and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. Everyone in jail; chains fell off and cell doors&#xa;opened and the jailer and his whole household got saved and baptized. A time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth, for the are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks. God is Spirit, and His worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth. Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God  acceptably with reverence and awe, for our &quot;God is a consuming fire&quot;. Some external expressions of&#xa;acceptable worship -clap your hands, all you nations shout to God with cries of joy. God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets. Sing praises to God, sing praises to our King, sing praises. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to His Name; bring an offering and come to His courts. Worship the Lord in the splendor of His holiness, tremble before Him, all the earth; sing to the Lord a new song, for He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation&#xa;for him. Make music to the Lord with the harp , trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn -shout for joy before the Lord, the King; let them praise His Name with dancing and make music to Him with tambourine and harp. Praise Him with the sounding of the trumpet , praise Him with the harp and lyre, praise Him with tambourine and dancing, praise Him with the clash of cymbals, praise Him with resounding cymbals. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.&#xa;&#xa;Corporate Prayer:&#xa;The disciples all joined together constantly in prayer as they waited for the day of Pentecost and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit when the believers heard of Peter and John's arrest and persecution at the hands of the Sanhedrin, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. In the midst of persecution the prayer requests of the believers were: Now, Lord, consider their threads and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs&#xa;and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus. Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. Then God sent an angel to free Peter form prison. The Antioch church leaders were worshipping and fasting, and praying when God called Saul and Barnabas to the mission field. Before they sent Paul and Barnabas off after fasting and praying, they placed their hands on them and sent them off. If two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done&#xa;for you by my Father in heaven. Jesus promises that where two or three come together in my Name there He is with them. Agreement is essential in corporate prayer. Jesus:&quot; I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, &quot;Go, throw yourself into the sea; and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&quot;&#xa;Ask the Lord for the harvest, therefore, to send workers into His harvest field. After the disciples prayed, the place where they were&#xa;meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the Word of God boldly. Prayer List: Paul: I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better. I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints. I pray that out of His glorious riches He may strengthen you with&#xa;power through His Spirit in your inner beings so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ. And this is my prayer; that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that&#xa;comes through Jesus Christ -to the glory and praise of God; for this reason since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful -And pray pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our massage, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. Epaphras was&#xa;always wrestling in prayer for the Colossians so that they may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered form wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith. I always thank God as I remember you in my prayers, because I hear about your (Philemon) faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. I pray that you may be active in sharing&#xa;your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.&#xa;&#xa;Personal Prayer:&#xa;But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&#xa;Paul: I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better, I pray also that the eye of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, I pray that out of His glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner beings so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I&#xa;pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ; And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ -to the glory and praise of God; For this reason, since the day&#xa;we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding; Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful -And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. Epaphras was always wrestling in prayer for the Colossians so that they may stand firm in all the&#xa;will of God, mature and fully assured; Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered form wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith; I always thank God as I remember you in my prayers, because I hear about your love for all the saints. I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. Jesus:&quot; I tell you the truth, if&#xa;anyone says to this mountain, &quot;Go, throw yourself into the sea; and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&quot; Ask the Lord for the harvest, therefore, to send workers into His harvest field. For personal prayer it is important to have a private place and a specific time. We should go into our rooms, close the door and pray to our Father, who is unseen. We&#xa;should pray for God's Kingdom to come and for His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven; for Him to give us our daily bread, to forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors; for Him not to lead us into temptation, but to deliver us from the evil one. Jesus promises: Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. Therefore, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it and it will be yours. If you believe you will receive whatever&#xa;you ask for in prayer. We should pray persistently because God will see that those who do get justice, and quickly. We must pray in Jesus' Name. In everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, we should present our requests to God. He is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, he hears us. And if we know that He hears us -whatever we ask- we know that we have what we asked of Him.&#xa;&#xa;Giving &amp; Tithing:&#xa;Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. Honor the Lord with your wealth; with the first fruits of all your crops (tithes). We must give a tithe of everything, not just your official salary, and it should be the first part not the left-over part and it should be before taxes. God said: Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, &quot;Test me in this.&quot; says the Lord Almighty, &quot;and see if I will not open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so&#xa;much blessing that you will not have room enough for it. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Jesus said: &#x201c;I tell you the truth, this poor widow put in more than all the others. All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on. Paul bragged about the generosity of the Macedonian believers: Out of the most severe trail, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty&#xa;welled up in rich generosity. The Macedonian formula for generosity: severe trail + extreme poverty + overflowing joy= rich generosity. The Macedonians gave as much as they were able to and even beyond their ability. These extreme givers are called heroes of the faith. The Macedonians even urgently pleaded for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.&#xa;&#xa;Teaching:&#xa;Paul told Timothy to entrust the things he has heard Paul say in the presence of his witnesses to reliable men who will  also be qualified to teach others. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. See to it that no-one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.&#xa;&#xa;Anointing:&#xa;Anointing is also new testament. It is used for healing.&#xa;&#xa;Healing:&#xa;Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.&#xa;&#xa;Prophecy:&#xa;Do not treat prophecies with contempt. We should eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. We should be eager to prophecy and not forbid speaking in tongues.&#xa;&#xa;Fasting:&#xa;When you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&#xa;&#xa;How to treat your enemies:&#xa;Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.&#xa;Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice. If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.&#xa;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&#xa;(Saul's conversion on the Damascus road AD 35) (Caligula becomes the Roman emperor AD 37) (Herod Agrippa appointed king of Judea AD 40) (The conversion of Cornelius AD 40) (Claudius becomes the Roman emperor AD 41) (Saul/Paul begins his first missionary journey AD 46) (The Jerusalem Council AD 49) (Romans begin using soap AD 50) (Paul begins his third missionary journey AD 51) (Emperor Claudius poisoned by order of his wife AD 54) (Nero becomes the Roman emperor AD 54)&#xa;(Paul in prison in Caesarea AD 57) (Paul's voyage to Rome AD 59) (Paul is released form prison in Rome AD 62) (Paul is martyred AD 64) (Fire burns Rome, Nero blames Christians AD 64) (Painting on canvas AD 66) (Romans destroy a religious commune at Qumran AD 68) (Rome destroys Jerusalem.
